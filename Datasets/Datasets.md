# Datasets
After all quality filters implemented in the WGS pipeline we had 568 *B.g. tritici* isolates. We defined and number of datasets that we used for different analyses:

1. <ins>World</ins>. This dataset comprises of all Bgt isolates (568 samples; `tritici_2022+before2022+2023+ncsu_no_clones.args`)
2. <ins>Europe+</ins>. This datatset comprises all Bgt isolates that were sampled between 25 and 60 degree latitude North, and between -9 and 60 degree longitude (Europe, Middle East and Caucasus; 415 samples; `tritici_extended_europe_2022+before2022+2023+ncsu.args`). 
3. <ins>Europe+_recent</ins>. This dataset comprises only Bgt isolates included in the Europe+ dataset that have been sampled in 2015 or more recently (368 samples; `tritici_recent_extended_europe_2022+2023+ncsu.args`)
4. <ins>Europe+_2022_2023</ins>. This dataset comprises of only those Bgt isolates in the Europe+_recent dataset that were collected in 2022 or 2023 (255 samples; `tritici_2022_2023.args`)

The metadata file with all isolate details, population labels and ancestry proportions is `2022+before2022+2023+ncsu_metadata+fs+admxK7_19032024.csv`
