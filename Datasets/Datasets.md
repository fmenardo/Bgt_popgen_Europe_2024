# Datasets
After all quality filters implemented in the WGS pipeline we had XX isolates. We defined and number of datasets that we used for different analyses:

1. Bgt_world. This dataset comprises of all Bgt isolates (568 samples; `tritici_2022+before2022+2023+ncsu_no_clones.args`)
2. Bgt_europe_extended. This datatset comprises all Bgt isolates that were sampled between 25 and 60 degree latitude North, and between -9 and 60 degree longitude (Europe, Middle East and Caucasus; 416 samples; `tritici_extended_europe_2022+before2022+2023+ncsu.args`). 
3. Bgt_europe_extended_recent. This dataset comprises only Bgt isolates included in teh Bgt_europe_extended dataset that have been sampled in 2015 or more recently (361 samples; `tritici_recent_extended_europe_2022+2023+ncsu.args`)
